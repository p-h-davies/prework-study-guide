## Description

The motivation of this project was to create a simple web application to store notes on various code languages for coding beginners. It was built to assist new coders, including myself. It solves the problem of having notes stored in different spaces (e.g. notebooks, documents and OneNote) - now all basic language notes are in one easy-to-access place! 

I learnt quite a lot during the project, specifically the basics of HTML, CSS, GitHub and Javascript.
